# SCRU-160: Sortable, Clock and Random number-based Unique identifier

SCRU-160 ID is yet another attempt to supersede [UUID] in the use cases that
need decentralized, globally unique time-ordered identifiers. SCRU-160 is
inspired by [ULID] and [KSUID] and has the following features:

- 160-bit length
- Sortable by generation time (in binary and in text)
- At least 32,767 unique, time-ordered IDs per millisecond
- Nearly 111-bit randomness for collision resistance
- 32-character base32hex encoding and 40-character hex encoding
- Case insensitive

```javascript
import { scru160, scru160f } from "scru160";

console.log(scru160()); // e.g. "05TTUP1HNCPNH30VEK64KDQT9BSNU4C4"
console.log(scru160()); // e.g. "05TTUP1HNCPNIB63R8IN5V2L3VFGNFET"

console.log(scru160f()); // e.g. "017bdf6431bb33750751eb63beb3c3f8c5969d86"
console.log(scru160f()); // e.g. "017bdf6431bb337662412e6a5758890735c33c2b"
```

## Binary Layout and Byte Order

A SCRU-160 ID is an 160-bit object that consists of the following four fields:

| Bit #        | Field     | Data Type                           |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Msb 0 - 47   | timestamp | 48-bit unsigned integer, big-endian |
| Msb 48 - 63  | counter   | 16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian |
| Msb 64 - 79  | random16  | 16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian |
| Msb 80 - 159 | random80  | 80-bit unsigned integer, big-endian |

- `timestamp` - Unix time in milliseconds
- `counter` - Reset to a 15-bit random number when `timestamp` changes;
  incremented by one for each new ID generated within the same `timestamp` (a
  different implementation may reset it to a smaller random number or zero to
  accommodate more IDs per millisecond)
- `random16` - Random number (documented separately from `random80` for future
  expansion)
- `random80` - Random number

Cryptographically secure random number generators are employed if possible.

## Encodings

The _base32hex_ encoding as defined in [RFC 4648] is used by default to produce
a 32-character textual representation consisting of `[0-9A-V]`.

[rfc 4648]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648

```javascript
scru160(); // e.g. "05TUIM8J8SU9O6P30I56PP49PI0RGNPM"
```

Alternatively, hexadecimal encoding can be used to produce a 40-character hex
string that looks like the commonly seen SHA-1 hashes.

```javascript
scru160f(); // e.g. "017be95b2d6042db903a19a0974182ec7445188a"
```

The base32hex representations and hex representations cannot be mixed when
SCRU-160 IDs need to be lexicographically sortable.
